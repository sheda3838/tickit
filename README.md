✅ Tickit - To-Do App

An assessment project to practice MERN + MySQL full-stack development.

This project simulates a simple to-do application with Google authentication and full CRUD functionality, demonstrating understanding of both front-end and back-end concepts.

🏥 Purpose

The main goal of this project is to practice and test MERN + MySQL knowledge after learning the theory.
It was created as part of a learning assessment to understand how a full-stack application works end-to-end.

✨ Key Features

Google Authentication / Registration

Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) tasks

Organize tasks with a simple interface

Front-end built with React

Back-end API routes with Node.js & Express

Data stored in MySQL database

🛠 Tech Stack

Frontend: React.js, HTML, CSS

Backend: Node.js, Express.js

Database: MySQL

Authentication: Google OAuth

📌 Deployment

Project hosted on GitHub (no live demo available)

Full-stack application; can be run locally using Node.js

🧠 What I Learned

How React components work and manage state

Implementing Google OAuth authentication

Designing backend routes for CRUD operations

Interacting with MySQL database from the backend

Connecting frontend to backend in a full-stack application

🚀 How to Run Locally

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/sheda3838/tickit.git


Install dependencies:

cd backend

npm install

cd ../frontend

npm install


Start the backend and frontend servers:

# Backend
cd backend

npm run dev

# Frontend
cd frontend

npm run dev

Open the app in your browser (usually http://localhost:5173)

Test Google login and CRUD operations for tasks

📌 Notes

Full-stack project, front-end and back-end connected locally

Database configuration is required for MySQL connection
